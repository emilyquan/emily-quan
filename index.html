<!--
I'm a UI/UX designer who connects design and development. With a background in Computer Science and Interactive Arts & Technology, I bring both creative vision and technical experience to every project. I love solving problems at the intersection of sleek interfaces and clean code, whether I'm prototyping in Figma or building with React. My dual perspective as a designer and developer helps me create experiences that not only look great but actually work seamlessly. I'm always exploring how thoughtful design and development can come together to make interfaces people genuinely enjoy using.

With a background in Computer Science and Interactive Arts & Technology, I can take an idea from concept to reality, whether that's prototyping in Figma or building with React. I work well with both designers and developers, which helps me create experiences that look good and function seamlessly.
