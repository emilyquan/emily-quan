                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>As part of SFU Surge's SparkJam design sprint, my team and I developed Euodia — a speculative smartwatch concept designed to help humans survive in a post-apocalyptic world.</p>
                <p>For this project, I took on the trade network feature, designing the user interface and bringing it to life through animations and interactive prototyping. My work focused on creating smooth microinteractions that made the trading system feel responsive and futuristic.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h3>Our Idea</h3>
                <p>When an alien virus overruns the world, survivors need more than just strength — they need the right information at the right time. We designed a futuristic smartwatch that acts as a compact survival companion. With GPS navigation, a trade network, an infected species database, and real-time health tracking, it puts everything users need to survive right on their wrist.</p>

                <h3>Design Process</h3>
                <h4>Initial Iterations</h4>
                <p>Our first attempts missed the mark.</p>
                <p>Early on, our prototypes were cluttered and lacked clear direction. We initially focused too heavily on the hologram feature, but eventually realized that the watch and hologram needed to work together as a system. The turning point came when we received feedback to imagine someone using this product during an active zombie fight. That shifted everything - we started designing for high-intensity survival situations.</p>
                <p>So we completely pivoted our approach!</p>
                <p>We went back to basics with extensive sketching and deep worldbuilding. We needed to nail down our story and truly understand the world we were designing for. Our focus shifted to the smartwatch interface as the primary tool, with the hologram serving as secondary support for non-essential information.</p>
                <p>After multiple rounds of interface sketches and a clearer vision, we moved into wireframing. The team agreed to embrace a more futuristic aesthetic, drawing heavy inspiration from Cyberpunk. We dove into research on futuristic user interfaces and gathered visual references to guide our direction.</p>

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>This project pushed me to explore speculative design in ways I hadn't before. Designing the trade network interface taught me how to craft animations and interactions that feel both futuristic and functional. The worldbuilding process also showed me how narrative context shapes every design decision. When you understand the world your product exists in, you can create something that feels real and meaningful to its users.</p>
