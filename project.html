                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>As part of SFU Surge's SparkJam design sprint, my team and I developed Euodia — a speculative smartwatch concept designed to help humans survive in a post-apocalyptic world.</p>
                <p>For this project, I took on the trade network feature, designing the user interface and bringing it to life through animations and interactive prototyping. My work focused on creating smooth microinteractions that made the trading system feel responsive and futuristic.</p>

                <h3>Our Idea</h3>
                <p>When an alien virus overruns the world, survivors need more than just strength — they need the right information at the right time. We designed a futuristic smartwatch that acts as a compact survival companion. With GPS navigation, a trade network, an infected species database, and real-time health tracking, it puts everything users need to survive right on their wrist.</p>

                <h3>Design Process</h3>
                
                <h4>Initial Iterations</h4>
                <p>Early on, our prototypes were cluttered and lacked clear direction, as displayed in the image below. We initially focused too heavily on the hologram feature, but eventually realized that the watch and hologram needed to work together as a system. The turning point came when we received feedback to imagine someone using this product during an active zombie fight. That shifted everything - we started designing for high-intensity survival situations.</p>

                    <img src="img/old_trade.png" width="1133" height="744" alt="The initial designs of the trading hub with a cluttered interface">
                </div>
                <p>We went back to basics with extensive sketching and deep worldbuilding. We needed to nail down our story and truly understand the world we were designing for. Our focus shifted to the smartwatch interface as the primary tool, with the hologram serving as secondary support for non-essential information.</p>

                <h4>Second Iterations</h4>
                <div class="project-image">
                    <img src="img/sketches.png" width="1000" height="613" alt="Revised sketching to improve user interface and flow after critique session">
                </div>
                <p>After multiple rounds of interface sketches and a clearer vision, we moved into wireframing. The team agreed to embrace a more futuristic aesthetic, drawing heavy inspiration from Cyberpunk. We dove into research on futuristic user interfaces and gathered visual references to guide our direction.</p>

                    <img src="img/second_trade.png" width="1133" height="744" alt="The second iterations of the trading hub designs with a cleaner cyberpunk interface">
                </div>
                <p>We selected typefaces that pair a futuristic, tech-inspired look with high readability—sharp, geometric forms for headings create a bold, modern feel, while supporting typefaces offer clear letterforms that remain legible at small sizes and quick glances.</p>
                <div class="project-image">
                    <img src="img/00.png" width="1000" height="613" alt="Final iterations of the trading hub interface with added colours of green and yellow">
                </div>
                <p>The color palette centers around greens and yellows, chosen for their modern yet subdued quality that won't strain the eyes or draw unwanted attention during a zombie virus outbreak. This combination ensures the interface feels forward-thinking and discreet, allowing users to access vital information without alerting nearby threats while maintaining accessibility and user experience.</p>

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>This project pushed me to explore speculative design in ways I hadn't before. Designing the trade network interface taught me how to craft animations and interactions that feel both futuristic and functional. The worldbuilding process also showed me how narrative context shapes every design decision. When you understand the world your product exists in, you can create something that feels real and meaningful to its users.</p>
